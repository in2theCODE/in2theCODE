## 🌱 My Journey

When I first learned about artificial intelligence and everything it could do, I became absolutely fascinated. So much so, I shut down my painting company just to dive in and learn as much as I could. I still paint occasionally to pay the bills—but soon, I hope to transition to being a full-time developer.

Above all, I’m an entrepreneur. I’ll always work for myself, building, experimenting, and creating. My mission: to make powerful, AI-driven tools and knowledge accessible to everyone—especially those who, like me, felt the “entry” was blocked by confusing jargon and a lack of transparency.

## 💡 What I’m Working On

- **AI, ML, and Agent Integration**  
  Building a platform that lets anyone create and use agents to enrich their lives—especially developers.
- **RAG Apps & Vibe Coding**  
  My “vibe coding” style combines high-level architectural vision with a hands-on, AI-collaborative approach: I handle the architecture, AI handles the syntax. This creates a true human-AI symbiosis.
- **Startups**  
  - `in2theCODE` (main platform)
  - `grumpybugstudios` & `in2thehivemedia` (sister startups)
- **Content Channels**  
  Launching soon—stay tuned!

## 🌍 My Vision

Everyone on the planet should have a basic understanding of development and how to “speak to computers.”  
Programming is just communicating with computers in their language. The tools I build aim to lower the barriers for everyone—because the ah-hah moment is worth it.

_“Trying new things, taking risk, and taking that first step is one of the most uncomfortable, skin crawling things we can do in life. But isnt funny when we do and find our way we look back and think to ourselves, why didnt I do this sooner. I have had an interesting life so far, the highest of highs and the lowest of lowes and I learned something, humans are the most adaptable creatures God created. Stop stalling and get after it!!!!”_
