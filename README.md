- 👋 Hi, I’m @in2theCODE
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack applications that leverage large language
  models to unlock new and exciting features that were never before possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build polygot's that are performant, optimized, and powerful.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on content creation that involves artificial inteligence,
 development, and teaching my new style of programming to anyone that has a thirst for breaking
into the digital world the same way I did. 
- 📫 How to reach me email is good but your better off sending a text message for a more indepth response for
whatever it is that initiated the inquiryl. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He , Him , His , Dude, Homie, Engineer, Programmer, Bro, 
- ⚡ Fun fact: One year ago I closed the doors on my successful painting company and chose to take my chances as a developer to earn a living.
  at that point in my life I had not yet even wrote one line of code or even understood any of the various programming languages syntax or context.
  But through drive and determination I developed a new way to write software application's and now I have bundled it all in a mastery based
  progressive learning env.
